      Incredibly honored to receive the Kampung Spirit Fund Scholarship valued at $3,000! 🙏💸

      This award holds a special place in my heart because it doesn't just judge on grades—it recognizes the "Jack of All Trades." It validates the late nights spent balancing academic rigor with community service, drone soccer, and coding projects.

      Being a generalist isn't about mastering nothing; it's about having the courage to try everything. 🚀
